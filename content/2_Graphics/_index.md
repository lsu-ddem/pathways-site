The following chapters, lessons, and assignments will focus on using your understanding of coding basics to create 2D graphics and games using the p5.js and p5.play.js libraries. Topics covered include basic procedural drawing techniques (placing shapes on a cartesian plane canvas, RGB & Alpha color mixing, and making custom/complex polygons), and game building using Object-Oriented Programming skills.

While completing these lessons, be sure to check out additional examples and extended readings in the **Resources** section as well as the [p5.js](http://p5js.org/reference/) and [p5.play.js](http://molleindustria.github.io/p5.play/docs/index.html) library reference websites to build a stronger understanding of these concepts.
