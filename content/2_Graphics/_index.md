## Unit 2

---

While writing and updating these lessons for the 2022-2023 school year, the p5.play library has updated to version 3. You may notice various discrepancies between the textbook and the reference materials, as well as notice various features breaking depending on which version of the code you are using. Please bare with us as we continue to test and update this unit with the most up-to-date information.

The following chapters, lessons, and assignments will focus on using your understanding of coding basics to create 2D graphics and games using the p5.js and p5.play.js libraries. Topics covered include basic procedural drawing techniques (placing shapes on a cartesian plane canvas, RGB & Alpha color mixing, and making custom/complex polygons), and game building using `Object-Oriented Programming` skills.

While completing these lessons, be sure to check out additional examples and extended readings in the **Resources** section as well as the [p5.js](http://p5js.org/reference/) and [p5.play.js](http://molleindustria.github.io/p5.play/docs/index.html) library reference websites to build a stronger understanding of these concepts.
