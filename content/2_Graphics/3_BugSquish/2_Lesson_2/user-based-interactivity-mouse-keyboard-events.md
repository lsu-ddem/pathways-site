## Moving Your Sprites

Here is an example of a sketch that allows our sprite to move around the canvas in different ways.

{{% codepen 600 RzPbrY %}}

If you look at functions `mousePressed()` and `keyPressed()` you can see specific properties and methods used to tell the sprite how to move around the canvas. By clicking the mouse, we can use `.attractionPoint()` to indicate a spot the sprite should move to. This is great for a "click and move" type environment common in many games. 

But what if you want to move by using the keyboard? Inside of keyPressed() we can see a series of conditional statements that test to see if a certain key is pressed. because we are using .setSpeed() as the results of this test, we can tell the sprite to move up, down, left, and right to match with the arrow keys. Using this logic we can tell our sprites how to move around the canvas. Different sprites can be mapped to different key combinations, or multiple sprites can be given the same keys to have identical, synchronized movements.

When using `.setSpeed()` we need to specify both the speed (pixels per frame) to move, and a direction to move in (degrees). Below is a chart of some common directions to move in as well as the degree that corresponds to that direction.

| Angle (degrees) | Direction                |
| --------------- | ------------------------ |
| 0               | RIGHT                    |
| 90              | DOWN                     |
| 180             | LEFT                     |
| 270             | UP                       |
| 45              | RIGHT-DOWN DIAGONAL      |
| 135             | LEFT-DOWN DIAGONAL       |
| 225             | LEFT-UP DIAGONAL         |
| 135             | RIGHT-UP DIAGONAL        |

Keep in mind that in p5, 0 degrees is always _horizontally to the right_, and the numbers _increase moving clockwise_ around a circle.

It is recommended to give each sprite a `.friction` value in the setup function when moving them around the canvas. This will make the sprite eventually stop moving, as if real-world friction wa being applied to the object. Without this, the sprite would move forever in the direction most recently pressed. Friction values range between 0 and 1 in p5.play. For most instances, having a value of between 0.01 and 0.2 will prove useful. You can also set a `.maxSpeed` value in order to prevent your sprite form accelerating too much if the same direction is continually pressed or held down. Both of these are properties.

## Assigning Movement to Keys

Lets take a second to look at the p5 sketch below. This was made by a previous student in the course and does a great job at setting up what we need to move a sprite with specific key presses.

You will notice that whenever you press a key on the keyboard, a number appears on the canvas. This number is the ASCII code for that key. All keys on a keyboard have a specific numeric value assigned to them. For example, all space bars have an ASCII value of 32, Escape keys are 27, and all return keys have an ASCII value of 13. This is useful because by using ASCII you can map a specific movement to a key regardless of the language or of the keyboard. To map the movements, we can take what we just learned and combine it with the ASCII code in a conditional like below:

```js
if(keyIsPressed){
    if(keyCode === 32){
        sprite.setSpeed(1,270);
    }
}

```

This example would have a sprite (poorly named "sprite") move up every time the space bar was pressed. By nesting the ASCII check with the `keyIsPressed` check, the sprite will only jump if a key is pressed AND it is the correct one. This can be useful to keep a sprite from moving after a key has been released.

### Let's Practice!

For this practice, lets explore a little more with moving a sprite with key presses. Using the above p5 sketch and nested conditional, create a sketch where you can move 2 sprites on the canvas. move one using the arrow keys and the other using the WASD keys. The sprite's directional movements should match up with the keys in a logical manner. This is the basis of simple character movement in many video games. 

For an added challenge, try working out how to make a sprite jump and return to the ground whenever the space bar is pressed. (this will involve some sort of gravity value and the setSpeed() or velocity method/property)

## Automatic Movement

We can also use these methods and parameters to set automatic movements. In the code below there is an additional sprite that now moves automatically. This is done by setting the movement speed and direction inside of `setup()` and then utilizing conditional statements inside of `draw()` to adjust those properties. Try changing the values of the properties in order to change how the sprite named `otto` automatically moves around the canvas. Try adding new properties and methods as well!

Later on we will discuss how to program collisions with other sprites to build more complex environments to move through.
