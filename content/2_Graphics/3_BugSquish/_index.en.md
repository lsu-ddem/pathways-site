## Chapter 6

This chapter will ask you to use using the p5.play.js library to build "Bug Squish!", an interactive game. The following lessons will introduce you to adding the library to your project, the basics of building and controlling interactive Objects in your game (aka "sprites"), watching for and reacting to collisions between sprites, and how to group similar sprites together into Groups. But first we need to add an extra library into our P5 projects.
