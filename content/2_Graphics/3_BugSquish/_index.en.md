## Chapter 6

This chapter will ask you to use using the p5.play.js library to build "Bug Squish!", an interactive game. The following lessons will introduce you to the basics of building and controlling interactive Objects in your game (aka "sprites"), watching for and reacting to collisions between sprites, and how to group similar sprites together into Groups, and creating unique sprite appearances by adding images and animations to your sketches.

 But first we need to add an extra library into our p5 projects. Without this code library none of the other information in this chapter would even work! Go to the next page to see how to add p5.play to your sketches.
