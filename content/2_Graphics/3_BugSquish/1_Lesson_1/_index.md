## Including the p5.play Library


For p5.play.js to work in your sketch you need to include it in your HTML file. We can use the [jsDelivr](https://jsDelivr.com) website to generate a link to the P5.play library's github source code. A link is provided for you below.

Open your project-folder and find the index.html file. Add this line under the first three script tags, replacing the URL in the quotes with the URL you just copied from cdnjs.com:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/molleindustria/p5.play/lib/p5.play.js"></script>
```

Once you have added this line, save your HTML file and head back to your "sketch.js" file. This loads p5.play.js in your sketch.
