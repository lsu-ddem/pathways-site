The upcoming assignment will be to recreate four images using p5 and a few advanced shape/color tools. We have some experience with shapes from the last unit, but for this we will need to go over a few more basic concepts:

* Review of basic shapes
* Introduction to more advanced and custom shapes
* Color and transparency
