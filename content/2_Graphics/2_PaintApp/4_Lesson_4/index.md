### Teacher's note:

This project can be completed both with or without objects. Both methods can result in identical programs. (The example below is made with a class that defines the color boxes on the side of the canvas.)

While students can complete this project using strings to represent pre-set color names, it is recommended that they utilize RGB values as a way to practice the format. 

Lastly, the particular shades shown in these examples and the number of options are mearly suggestions. If desired a student could create a paint app using which ever shades they wanted. Let your creativity flow!
