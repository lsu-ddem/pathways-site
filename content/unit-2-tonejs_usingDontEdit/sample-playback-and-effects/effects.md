Effects in Tone.js alter the sound is some way. They can effect the timbre or rhythm of the sound.

## Making connections

* toMaster()
  * sends the sound directly to your speakers
  * if you are missing toMaster() you will not hear anything
* connect()
  * Sends the sound to an effect before it goes to the master

Every effect has a range that the effect can be applied to the sound, also called its **wet** value.

Below are some effects you can use for your Sampler with effects assignment. More information of other effects can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=17qRwp8q--n8KOMZeJDm_EDuTDy6vDH4n).
