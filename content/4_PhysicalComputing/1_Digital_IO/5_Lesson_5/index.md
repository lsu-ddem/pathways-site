title: 'Assignment #1: Controlling Multiple objects at Once'
weight: '6'
---

Below is a starter Arduino code for this assignment. Your goal is to control multiple components with the use of a single button or switch. Think back to the previous examples in the chapter. We already did a little bit of this, but now you cannot use the built in LED. LEDs are recommended for this assignment, but are not required. If you have other components that you are able to connect to the circuit and control via a single button or switch then you may utilize whatever you wish. A minimum of 2 components are required. You may attempt more than that, but keep in mind that adding additional components will take up more space on your breadboard and become harder to manage.
