## Chapter 6

The following lessons and assignments will introduce students to the practice of Physical Computing using the Arduino platform. While code for the Arduino is not written in JavaScript, the syntax and structure of basic coding concepts covered in previous chapters will carry over to these lessons with only minor changes required. Topics covered include basic understanding of electrical signals and components for building circuits, analog and digital input and output into an interactive circuit, understanding differences between JavaScript and Arduino coding, and how to get an Arduino to communicate with a web-based project.

While completing these lessons, be sure to check out additional examples and extended readings in the **Resources** section as well as the lessons and example codes found on the [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/HomePage) website to build a stronger understanding of these concepts.
