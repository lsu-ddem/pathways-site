## Chapter 6

The following lessons and assignments will introduce students to the practice of Physical Computing using the Arduino platform. **While code for the Arduino is not written in JavaScript, the syntax and structure of basic coding concepts covered in previous chapters will carry over to these lessons with only minor changes required.** Topics covered include basic understanding of electrical signals and components for building circuits, analog and digital input and output into an interactive circuit, understanding differences between JavaScript and Arduino coding, and how to get an Arduino to communicate with a web-based project.

While completing these lessons, be sure to check out additional examples and extended readings in the **Resources** section as well as the lessons and example codes found on the [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/HomePage) website to build a stronger understanding of these concepts.

## Specific differences between Arduino and Javascript, and things to note:

Below is a list of some of the more common differences and functions that we will come across when using arduino for this class. Be sure to reference this page if you need a refresher on these items when you are working on your assignments. 

### void vs function

### loop vs draw

### const vs let

#### int & float

### pinMode()

### digitalWrite()

### digitalRead()

### analogRead()

### analogWrite()
