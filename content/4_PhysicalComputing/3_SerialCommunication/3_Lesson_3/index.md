title: Receiving Digital Data from P5
weight: '3'
---

The final part of this chapter will have us complete the opposite of what we have just spent the previous few lessons accomplishing: Using interactions with P5 in order to affect a physical component in our circuit board.

This lesson will be focusing on using LEDs and having them respond to commands from P5, however any digital output module could be substituted for an LED depending on what components you have access to or purchase outside of this course. A fun, inexpensive option is a buzzer that wil emit a noise whenever a HIGh signal is given to it. More information and links to these components are listed in this chapters page in the [Additional Resources section](https://pdm.lsupathways.org/6_resources/).

Like in the previous lesson we will be building off of the previous examples codes and circuit boards. If you need to check out the previous lessons in order to make sure your circuit board and codes are up to date before moving forward. Once you have gone through the previous two lessons lets move on. This is the final push!

## The Circuit

Before starting this lesson your circuit should look something like this:

Now we will be adding in a simple LED circuit similar to the ones we did in the beginning of this unit. Follow the steps below in order to add in an LED. Be sure not to change any connections to the arduino as this will break the project when we try to use it later on.

## Arduino Code

We will start by having our code respond with a digital HIGH/LOW command to turn the LED on and off. The next lesson will be where we explore using PWM to have a more finite control to the LED controls.
