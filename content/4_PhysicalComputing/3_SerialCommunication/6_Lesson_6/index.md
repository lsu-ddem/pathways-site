title: 'Adding Physical Control To a Program'
weight: '6'

The third and final assignment of the Physical computing unit is to combine sending receiving data between your Arduino and P5. Below are the details for the assignment:

* You may work with either your _Bug Squish_ or _Paint App_ programs for this assignment. You do not have to use the same one that you added sound effects to in the previous unit, however doing so will make for a more interesting final product.
* Your code P5 code must receive data from at least 1 digital and 1 analog input. which kind of input is up to you, but the values from the hard ware must influence the code in some way. 
* Your Arduino must receive data from P5 in order to manipulate at least LED.
* Your circuits must be properly connected with appropriate resistors where needed. (your assignment will not function otherwise)
* Lastly, you will need to document your assignment through both video and photograph. Be sure to take a picture of the completed bread board so that your instructor can view it without the need of both your code and hardware. Also, make a short video showing how your arduino and P5 are interacting. this will help your instructor with grading, as well as serve as a back up in case of  a hardware/software malfunction, or your circuit is accidentally dissembled.

Here is an example of this completed assignment.
