The following lessons will focus on adding serial communication to the completed "Bug Squish!" game **or** the "Paint App" from the previous chapters, allowing for control of your program from an Arduino. By the time you have completed this section you will have the following:

* A functional program that a user can interact with
* Working sounds that respond to various conditions of the game
* The ability to physically manipulate the computer code through physical means such as a button or sensor.

Before we move on however, there is one more item that needs to be installed on your device. This program helps to control the serial input and output going to P5 to avoid data conflicts with the ret of your computer. Follow the steps below to install this program on your device.
