title: Pulse Width Modulation and Creating Multiple Dimmer Switches
weight: '5'
---

The second assignment  in the physical computing unit will be to use sensors to crate different kinds of dimmer switches for an LED. However, before we can dive into that, there is one more topic that we need to cover: pulse width modulation. It is through this process that we will be able to control the digital signal that turns an LED on and off with an analog signal.

## PWM

### Applying to an LED

## Assignment 2: Multiple Dimmer Switches

Earlier on this page you were shown how to utilize pulse width modulation in order to use a potentiometer to control the brightness of an LED, this will be the basis of the assignment for this chapter. The goal of this assignment is to create a circuit with the following criteria;

* has a main power switch/button that supplies the entire circuit with power. None of the LEDs will turn on without this being 'on'.
* Has at least 2 separately wired LEDs.
* each LED can be controlled via PWM and a sensor (not a pot).
    * One sensor must ve a variable resistor (2 leads).
    * The other must be a voltage divider (3 leads).

Think about what elements you will need to code in order for this to work. You will have to combine multiple elements from the previous examples in order to achieve this. Feel free to utilize the code below as a starting point.
