title: Pulse Width Modulation and Creating Multiple Dimmer Switches
weight: '3'
---

The second assignment  in the physical computing unit will be to use sensors to crate different kinds of dimmer switches for an LED. however, before we can dive into that, there is one more topic that we need to cover: pulse width modulation. It is through this process that we will be able to control the digital signal that turns an LED on and off with an analog signal.
