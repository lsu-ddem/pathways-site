Lets go over some of the basics from the previous lessons:

---

## Analog signal

## Sensors and Variable Resistors

## Pulse Width Modulation

## Chapter 11 Review Assignment

The upcoming assignment is to create multiple dimmer switches for multiple LEDS using PWM **AND** different analog sensors . In order to practice for that assignment, start with the Arduino code from the PWM lesson. only this time experiment with different sensors and variable resistors in order to see which ones you like working with, or which ones are problematic to get the results you want.
