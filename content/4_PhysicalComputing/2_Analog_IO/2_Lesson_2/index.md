Now that we have an idea of what an analog signal is, lets look at some hardware that we can utilize to control these signals in real time:

## Potentiometers

### Linear vs Rotary

### Trim Potentiometers

## Sensors

### Light Sensor

### Force/Pressure Sensor

## Distance Sensor

## Movement Sensor

## Flex Sensor

## Temperature Sensor

## Volume Sensor
