title: What is an Analog Signal
weight: '1'
---
In the previous chapter we learned about sending and receiving digital signals: Signals with only high and low values. But what about the values between 0 and 1? Only having two options doesn't leave a lot of room for finite control of different components. That is where analog signals ans sensors come into play. When sending or recieving analog signals the computer is dealing with a decimal value somewhere in between 0 and 1.
