Sound Assignment # 2 Result

Find an image of an action or event that might occur.  Create a video game-like sound synthesis effect for this event. (Something like breaking a block with your head â€“ Super Mario style. Or diving into a pool.)  When the canvas is clicked, display an image of the event and trigger the corresponding sound event.

Utilize a collection of these elements:

* oscillator(s)
* noise(s)
* filter(s)
* modulation and/or LFOs
* envelope(s)
* synthesizers/instruments


Make sure to do modulation of at least one parameter. Use envelopes and time delays to have different sounds join into one sonic event (a sound object!).

No pre-generated audio files may be used.

Here is a working example of a potential solution:
