title: 'Sound Assignment #3 - Adding Sound Events to BugSquish or Paint App!'
weight: 4

This is the final assignment for the sound unit, and it will combine everything we have learned so far in the course: Basic coding skills, graphics and sprites, sound playback, synthesis, and sequencing.

The goal for this assignment is to take **EITHER** your _Bug Squish_ **or** _Paint App_ assignments from the graphics unit and add dynamic sounds to the user interactions. Below is a potential example of the _Bug Squish_ assignment with sounds added in.

and here is an example of the _Paint App_

Notice the characteristics that both of these have in common:

* Each project has at least 2 different synthesizer sounds and one sound file playback.
* The sounds change/are triggered based on the user interactions, and these changes make logical sense.
* the differences in sounds are noticeable.

Be sure to check through the previous two units as well as the resources section as you begin adding sound interactions to your project.
