For this assignment, the goal is to create a sketch that does the following:

* loads at least 8 unique sounds into the sketch with Tone.Players()
* playback of the sounds can be triggered by clicking a button
* at least 4 audio effects are applied to the sounds in sequence
* Each audio effect can be altered by a slider


Here is an example of a solution for Sound Assignment #1:

Remember the goal is to be able to trigger multiple sound effects using Tone.Players(), and apply an effect ot them with the use of on-screen sliders. If you felt that using buttons was simple, try and map the sound playback to various keyboard buttons as well.
