Audio effects are used to modulate and manipulate a sound source in order to create more experimental sonic results. Let's learn how to start incorporating effects into our web project! 

## Adding Audio Effects into the Signal Path

![null](/images/uploads/effects_pathway.png)

In order to pass sound from our sound source into an audio effect, we need to complete the following steps: 

1. Build our chosen audio effect, assign it to a variable, and connect its output to the master speakers (using the .toMaster( ) method)
2. Build our sound source, assign it to a variable, and connect its output to our audio effect (using a new method called **.connect( )**
3. The argument passed into the **.connect( )** method is the variable we created to store our audio effect 

Here is an example of how to add an audio effect into your code and attach it to the output of your sound file player. In the code embedded below, we create a delay effect and send the output of our Tone.Players object through the effect before it gets passed to our master output speakers. The sound, rather than moving directly from A -> B, is now moving from A -> C -> B. where A is the source file, B is the speaker, and C is the delay effect.

Every effect has a universal parameter called its **wet** value. The wet value represents the proportion of mix between the original (or "dry") sound source signal coming into the effect and the effected (or "wet") signal coming out of the effect. Try adjusting the slider in the embedded code above to hear the resulting sound at various rations of dry/wet mixes.


Remember to build your audio effects before you try to connect your sound source to them using the .connect( ) method. If you attempt to connect a sound source to an effect that hasn't been built yet, your code won't render even if your code has no other mistakes. Since our code is read from top to bottom, it's best to put the code that builds your effects above any code that connects sound sources to them, like below:

```
let effect1, effect2, effect3, effect4;

function preload(){

effect4 = new Tone.Freeverb().toMaster();
effect3 = new Tone.PitchShift(2).connect(effect4);
effect2 = new Tone.Tremolo(4, 0.6).connect(effect3);
effect1 = new Tone.FedbackDelay(0.5, 0.5).connect(effect2);

player = new Tone.Player('sound.mp3').connect(effect1);
}
```

By building the elements in this order, you can see the direct pathway from the speakers, through the effect chain, back to the sound file. Changing the order will cause the code not to execute because it will try ot connect a sound to an object that has not been created yet.Building the objects in preload ensures that the pathway is properly rendered prior to any potential sound playback triggers.

## Common Audio Effects

Tone.js has a large collection of audio effects that can be used to modulate a sound source. Below, we discuss some of the most commonly used audio effects and demonstrate how we can use them. To see a complete list of possible audio effects and their parameters in the Tone.js library, head to the library's API documentation by clicking [here](https://tonejs.github.io/docs/). 

### Reverb

Reverb is the persistance of a sound that continues after the original sound has ceased. It is made up of many echos bouncing off the walls of a space and gives us cues to the size of that space. If you have ever been in a very large room, think church, stadium etc; and heard your voice echo around it, this is reverb.

#### Reverb Parameters

* **roomSize** - the amount of time for the sound to decay.

### Delay

A delay effect records a sound into a buffer and plays it back after a certain period of time. The example below demonstrates a particular style of delay known as a PingPong Delay. This causes the delayed sound to pan back and forth between your right output speaker and your left output speaker.

#### Delay Parameters

* **delayTime** - the time between consecutive echos.
* **feedback** - the amount of the effected signal which is fed back through the delay.

### Distortion

Gives sound a “fuzzy”, “growling”, or “gritty” tone by increasing the amount of electric signal going through the circuit. Think electric guitar.

#### Distortion Parameters

* **distortion** - the amount of distortion (must use a nominal range of 0-1)
  * does _not_ require the addition of **.value** to modify

### Tremolo

Tremolo is the variation in amplitude of sound achieved through electronic means. Musically, it results in a "warbly", vibrato-induced sound. This effect works best on longer duration, sustained sounds.

Because the tremolo effect relies on an oscillator to generate the amplitude change, we need to add the .start( ) method upon creation of the effect. This can be done on the same line, right after the .toMaster( ) method is called. More information on oscillators can be found in the Resources section, as well as the next chapter.

#### Tremolo Parameters

* **frequency** - the rate of the effect, resulting in faster vibrato or slower vibrato
* **depth** - the depth of the effect upon the sound source

### BitCrusher

Bitcrusher is a distortion effect that creates a lo-fi version of the incoming sound source through a digital reduction of the audio's resolution (as known as its bit depth). 

#### BitCrusher Parameters

* **bits**- the number of bits to down sample the signal (must use a nominal range of 1 to 8)
  * does _not_ require the addition of **.value** to modify

{{% codepen 600 pKQmPM %}}


### PitchShift

PitchShift is an effect that changes the pitch of an incoming sound source by shifting its pitch up or down by a designated number of half steps. For audio files, this is done without having to change the player's **playbackRate** property.

#### PitchShift Parameters

* **pitch**- the number of half steps to shift the sound in pitch (positive numbers shift the pitch higher, negative numbers shift the pitch lower, and "0" keeps the sound at its original pitch
  * does _not_ require the addition of **.value** to modify

### Chorus

A Chorus effect combines elements of the Delay and Tremolo effects. An incoming sound source is slightly delayed and layered on top of the original, allowing one sound source to be perceived as a group of many. They layered, delayed "copies" are then modulated in amplitude, causing their pitch to waver slightly and not perfectly match the pitch of the original source. This simulates a natural effect that occurs when a chorus of singers or a group of instruments perform the same note simultaneously, with each individual performer playing slight out of tune from the next. This effect works best with a delay time between 2 and 20 milliseconds, and a slower frequency of modulation.

While the chorus effect is similar to the Tremolo effect, we do _**not**_ need to start an internal oscillator by adding the** .start( )** method upon creation of the effect. Also, the delayTime parameter for this effect does not need the additional **.value** property in order to be changed. 

#### Chorus Parameters

* **frequency** - the rate of the effect, resulting in faster vibrato or slower vibrato
* **delayTime** - The delay time in _milliseconds_ of the chorus (nominal range for a Chorus delay time is between 2 and 20ms)
  * does _not_ require the addition of **.value** to modify the parameter for this effect
* **depth** - the depth of the effect upon the sound source

 ## Final Notes

 Looking at these examples, we can see how the triggers for these sound playbacks are kept in their own functions to be triggered by buttons. The slider positions are checked and applied to the intended property every time the draw() function loops, and the signal pathways and sound files are loaded occurs inside of `preload()`.  All buttons and sliders are created inside of `setup()`.

 Using the information from the previous pages, we will now build a sampler that triggers multiple sounds, and applies adjustable effects to those sounds.

 One final note. if you build your effects, you can connect them all in one line with the `.chain()` method. THe syntax is:

 ```
 Tone.Player('soundfile').chain(effect1, effect2, effect3, Tone.Master)
 ```
