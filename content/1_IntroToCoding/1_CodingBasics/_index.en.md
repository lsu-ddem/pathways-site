## Elements of a Web Project

Each web project that we design is composed of a collection of files that come together to create our interactive art work. When creating these files locally on your computer, you should store them all in the same folder. When working in code editing apps such as VS Code, you will often have quick access to all files that are grouped within the same folder in case you need to change or update code across multiple files. When working in the P5.js Web Editor, creating a new File from main menu results in the automatic creation of a project folder  filled with pre-coded HTML and CSS files, and a JavaScript file that contains some starter code. 

Take a look at the HTML, JS, and CSS tabs in the embedded CodePen sketch below to learn more about what each of these files contain:
