Adding mathematical calculations to our code allows us to create projects that intelligently adapt to changes and change on their own. We can also use math equations to create basic animations and cycles of change for any element in our project.

Many of the same mathematical operators that we commonly encounter in the world are used in JavaScript, but there are some exceptions. Here is a quick chart of common math operations and their equivalent symbols in JavaScript: 

| Symbol | Operation      |
| ------ | -------------- |
| +      | Addition       |
| \-     | Subtraction    |
| \*     | Multiplication |
| /      | Division       |

# Using Math in Code

Lets look at a few examples of where we can use simple math in our code. In the example below, we've created four rows of squares. Each square is placed on the canvas based on the result of a different mathematical equation to determine its X and Y coordinate. Take a look at each grouping of **rect() **functions to see how we use the same "rectX" and "recY" variables, but return different location results based on the various equations we code for:
