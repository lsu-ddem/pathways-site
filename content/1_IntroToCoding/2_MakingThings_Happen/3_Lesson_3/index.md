## Why Use Loops?

Often times, projects that feature repeating patterns or duplicated actions result in a code that is overly long, and therefor difficult to troubleshoot. Take the following embedded code, which features a handful of alternating squares, as an example:

{{% codepen 400 pKPLJZ %}}

Take a look at the amount of repeating functions in our **draw()** block. We use one pair of **fill()** and **rect()** functions to create each square. Because of this, we would need 200 lines of code in order to make a line of 100 squares. There is also a significant amount of repetition within the arguments of each **rect()** function: the last three arguments (Y axis location, width, and height) of each **rect()** are exactly the same, with the X axis location being the only difference.

In order to simplify this process, we can create a self-contained loop that repeats a block of code for a set amount of times before stopping. This way, we can re-run the two lines of code needed to make the square as many times as we want without having to explicitly retype everything. 

This second version of the project uses a type of loop known as a **for loop** to create 100 squares, alternating between teal and pink colors in the **fill()** function and placing each square 20 pixels away from the previous one. This results in a much shorter code that then we would have had if we didn't use a loop :

## Understanding For Loops

The following logic chart breaks down the basic concept behind how a for loop works:

H(Create Variable)-->A
 A-->|False| E[Loop Stops]
A{Test} -->|True| B[Repeated Result Block]
B-->C[Update Variable Value]
C-->|Updated Variable Value|A

style B fill:  #ec7063, stroke:#FFFFFF;
style C fill:  #f7dc6f ,stroke:#FFFFFF;
style E fill: #FFFFFF, stroke:#FFFFFF;
style H fill:  #f7dc6f ,stroke:#FFFFFF;

To create a for loop, we first design a set of statements that control how many times the loop runs and separate each one with a semicolon. First, we create a variable for use in the loop and initialize it with a starting value. This variable is typically given a one-letter label and is different from any other variable we are using elsewhere in our code. Next, we define a test that evaluates this variable on every loop and keeps the loop running as long as the test passes. If the test fails, the loop stops immediately. The test is always a relational expression, relating the value on the left to the value on the right (a table of common relational expressions and their operators can be found below). Finally, we write a statement that allows the loop variable to be updated every time the test is passed. 

Translated into code, here is what the structure of a for loop looks like:

```
for (create variable; test; update variable){
   repeated result block
  }
```

In the embedded code below, our loop draws multiple lines. The variable i is declared with an initial value of 20. The loop runs for as long as i is less than 400. Every time the test passes, the value of i is updated to be the result of itself plus 8 (20, 28, 36, etc.). When i grows to be bigger than 400, the loop stops. Try adding `console.log(i)` inside of the loop's result block to see the growing value of i with each loop:

## Relational Expressions and their Operators

| Operator | Expression               |
| -------- | ------------------------ |
| \>       | Greater than             |
| <        | Less than                |
| \==      | Equal to                 |
| \>=      | Greater than or equal to |
| <=       | Less than or equal to    |
| !=       | Not equal to             |



## More For Loop Examples

Here are some examples of projects that use for loops to create complex designs. Try to determine how all three statements of the for loop work and how they create the resulting patterns for each code embedded below:

## Nested For Loops

H(Create Outer Variable)-->A
A-->|False| E[Loop Stops]
A{Outer Test} -->|True| M(Create Inner Variable)

B{Inner Test}-->|False|L[Inner Loop Stops]
M-->B

L-->K[Update Outer Variable Value]
K-->A
B-->|True|J[Repeated Result Block]


J-->C[Update Inner Variable Value]

C-->|Updated Variable Value|B

Translated into code, here is what the structure of a nested for loop looks like:

```
for (create outer variable; outer test; update outer variable){
   for (create inner variable; inner test; update inner variable){
      repeated result block
      }
  }
```

Here is another example of a nested for loop. Study this example to see how it works
