## Unit 1

The following lessons will focus on introducing students to the technical aspects of coding as a medium for artistic creation. These lesson require no previous knowledge of coding as a concept, computer science, or the JavaScript/HTML/CSS languages. Throughout this course, we will be primarily using the [**p5.js**](p5js.org) JavaScript library to create our coding projects. This library simplifies some aspects of creating web art with JavaScript, which makes it an ideal teaching environment for first-time coders. Some of the functions learned in this course may conflict with traditional JavaScript coding practices, but the conflicts are minimal. This course is currently built around the 10.2 version of the P5 library. utilizing a different version may result in discrepancies between the course materials and the web-editor.

While completing these lessons, be sure to check out additional examples and extended readings in the [Resources](https://pdm.lsupathways.org/6_resources/) section to build a stronger understanding of these concepts.
