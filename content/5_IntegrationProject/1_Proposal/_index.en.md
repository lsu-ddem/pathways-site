Before you begin on your project, you should submit a proposal to your instructor with the following informaiton:

* Discription of your project. (be as detailed as possible)
* How you will utilize elements from the graphics unit.
* How you will utilize elements from the audio unit.
* How you will utilize elements from the physicacl computing unit.
* External resources such as images, sounds, or physical computing components that you plan on needing.
* Any other important information about the project.


The purpose of this is so that your instructor can make sure that your project meets all of the criteria listed on the previous page, that your project can be completed in a reasonable timeline, and so they can manage resources to better help with any technical issues that may arise. 

Your instructor will either approve your proposal, or ask you to revise parts of it as needed before you begin working on the project.
