As you go through this course you may find various resources from different places. Some of these may utilize an older, non-web-based version of P5.js. Those examples will function almost identically to your version of P5, which was updated to run completely online a few years ago.

[Javascript.com](https://www.javascript.com/) contains multiple interactive javascript recourses that you can explore. [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/), [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/), [LearnJS](https://www.learn-js.org/), [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript), and [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) all offer tutorials and interactive classes on javascript as well. Be sure to explore these sites for additional practice working in javascript.

[Dan Shiffman's Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman) contains numerous coding resources and video lessons that can serve as an additional resource to accompany the materials of this class; especially the playlists specifically utilizing P5.js

More detailed information about various elements discussed in this course can be found in the book [Eloquent Javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) by Marijn Haverbeke. Once you have had a little practice using the language, check out this book for more in depth explications of various javascript features.

The [P5 reference pages](p5js.org/reference/) can offer information and examples on every function built into the P5 coding library.
