[The Arduino Reference Page](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en) functions similarly to the P5 reference page and contains information about every item built into the Arduino coding environment. This can be an especially helpful resource if you are unsure about the arguments or formats of the C++ based code.

Depending on the arduino kits used, they main contain a booklet of various circuits that can be built with the included components. For additional experience, try building various circuits recommended by the manufacturer.

[The chapter 10 introduction page](https://pdm.lsupathways.org/4_physicalcomputing/) contains a list of the common differences between the arduino code and the javascript that we have been using for the course up to this point. 

[learn.sparkfun.com](https://learn.sparkfun.com/) contains many instructional pages and tutorials on many of the concepts and components utilized in this course.

[This page](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pulse-width-modulation/all) contains more detailed information about Pulse Width Modulation and LEDs.

An [automatic calculator](http://www.resistorguide.com/resistor-color-code-calculator/) like this one can be used to easily determine the resistance of your fixed resistor.

A [voltage divider calculator](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/tools/voltage-divider-calculator/) is a handy tool for calculating the difference in voltages when wetting up a voltage divider in your circuits.

## Buying More Components

[Kits for the Arduino Uno](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=arduino+uno+kit&ref=nb_sb_noss_2) can by purchased for around $40-$60 each and will contain all of the necessary parts and sensors for this course. Additional sensors can be purchased, but it is not necessary. Other Arduino boards can be used, but the [Arduino Uno](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-uno-rev3) (or compatible 3rd party board) is recommended because it contains enough pins for all of the assignments for this course, and is easily able to accommodate jumper cables without soldering.

[Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/) and [DigiKey](https://www.digikey.com/) can both be used to order more parts and sensors for arduino projects if needed or desired. Keep in mind that certain parts may need to be ordered in bulk if you decide to order from these places.

## Diagrams

The application [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/home/) was used to generate many of the Arduino diagrams shown in this course. While not free, this program is inexpensive and allows for the user ot create highly customizable diagrams of their Arduino projects. The company also offers a platform for sharing projects and can create printed circuit boards that replicate your submitted projects in a more permanent fashion. This could be a potential resource for a mor impressive final project, but will require purchases, shipping, and the soldering of components. 

[This page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_symbol) shows how to interpret the symbols in traditional circuit diagrams

## Soldering

While it is not required, or recommended for this course, all of the circuits built could be soldered together for a permanent connection. If an instructor or student wishes to acquire the materials and continue exploring outside of the context of this class, please look at the following resources on the basics of soldering and practice proper safety. Remember, soldering irons are extremely hot!
