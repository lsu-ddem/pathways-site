A variable serves as a virtual container that we can store data in. This data can take the form of numbers, strings, entire objects, etc. You can put almost anything into a variable, and in fact for many of the lessons in the later half of his course you will need to. By storing something inside a variable you are essentially giving it a name that the code can refer to that item or value as. It is this feature that lets us reference the objects we make and adjust the various parameters, and why we need to store things like our synthesizers and audio effects inside of a variable when we create them.
