## Cutting a Sprite Sheet

A Sprite Sheet is an image that contains all of the sprites for a character or game. We can utilize these images, but first we have to separate the individual sprites from the larger image.

[Here](https://ezgif.com/sprite-cutter) is a link to an online tool for cutting out individual animation frames from a Sprite Sheet. This tool is a great time saver compared to manually cropping or taking screenshots, but it is not always perfect. Be sure to explore various options!

Other places such as [The Spriter's Resource](https://www.spriters-resource.com/), [Open Game Art](https://opengameart.org/), or [Game Art 2d](https://www.gameart2d.com/freebies.html) that will allow you to access various sprite images or sheets for free or relatively inexpensive rates. You will not be required to purchase anything for this course, but keep in mind that if you want to utilize a certain sprite image, it may not be legally available for free. Keep in mind that everything we do in this course will be 2D, so anything done with 3D animations will not be covered.
