For Tone.js to work in your sketch you need to include it in your HTML file.

Open your project-folder and find the index.html file. Add this line under the first three script tags:

```
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/tone/0.11.0/Tone.min.js"></script>
```

This loads Tone.js in your sketch.
