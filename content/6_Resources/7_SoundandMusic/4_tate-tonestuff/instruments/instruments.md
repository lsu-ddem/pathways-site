A code instrument is a combination of a synthesizer various envelopes, parameters, and effects placed on it so that the object now has its own unique timbre and controls. Because we are building our own instruments from the ground up whenever we code them, we can have an extremely precise level of control in how the user can interact with the instrument and what kinds of sounds it can produce.
