[Kits for the Arduino Uno](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=arduino+uno+kit&ref=nb_sb_noss_2) can by purchased for around $40-$60 each and will contain all of the necessary parts and sensors for this course. Additional sensors can be purchased, but it is not necessary. Other Arduino boards can be used, but the [Arduino Uno](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-uno-rev3) (or compatible 3rd party board) is recommended because it contains enough pins for all of the assignments for this course, and is easily able to accommodate jumper cables without soldering.

[The Arduino Reference Page](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en) functions similarly to the P5 reference page and contains information about every item built into the Arduino coding environment. This can be an especially helpful resource if you are unsure about the arguments or formats of the C++ based code.

Depending on the arduino kits used, they main contain a booklet of various circuits that can be built with the included components. For additional experience, try building various circuits recommended by the manufacturer.

[The chapter 10 introduction page](https://pdm.lsupathways.org/4_physicalcomputing/) contains a list of the common differences between the arduino code and the javascript that we have been using for the course up to this point. 

[Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/) and [DigiKey](https://www.digikey.com/) can both be used to order more parts and sensors for arduino projects if needed or desired. Keep in mind that certain parts may need to be ordered in bulk if you decide to order from these places. 

An [automatic calculator](http://www.resistorguide.com/resistor-color-code-calculator/) like this one can be used to easily determine the resistance of your fixed resistor.

## Setting up a 5V motor

Many kits come with a motor that can be utilized with the digital pins much like an LED. However, there are a few more parts that are needed in order to set this motor up. Watch the video below for a live-patching instruction for how to set up a motor that is controlled by a button.
