[The Arduino Reference Page](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en) functions similarly to the P5 reference page and contains information about every item built into the Arduino coding environment. This can be an especially helpful resource if you are unsure about the arguments or formats of the C++ based code.

[The chapter 10 introduction page](https://pdm.lsupathways.org/4_physicalcomputing/) contains a list of the common differences between the arduino code and the javascript that we have been using for the course up to this point. 

[Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/) and [DigiKey](https://www.digikey.com/) can both be used to order more parts and sensors for arduino projects if needed or desired. Keep in mind that certain parts may need to be ordered in bulk if you decide to order from these places.
