# Unit 3

**Overview:**

This unit aims at introducing students to the engineering design process and involving them in creative problem solving.

**Expected Lesson Duration:**

210 to 270 minutes

**Next Generation Science Standard(s) Addressed:**

**Outcomes/Objectives:**

Learn how design impacts product performance.Understand the difference in an innovation and an invention

Identify and describe the parts of the engineering design process.

Use the engineering design process to solve the problem.Employ the use of data collection and analysis to help solve the problem

Explain the reasons for their selected designs and material choices.

**Relevance/Rationale/Explorations and Extensions:**

The engineering design process is a highly involved, iterative set of steps that guide students through high-level problem solving. As an iterative process, the steps are often repeated in varying order. It is often compared to the scientific method, and tends to be as fluid as the method in its implementation. It is important to help students understand that, just like the scientific method, the engineering design process is not a cookie-cutter framework to be copied from each problem to the next. It is, instead, an iterative venture in which engineers approach the problem from multiple angles and frames of mind. 

**Assessment Criteria for Success:**

Content knowledge, student knowledge, and appropriate resources are aligned to instructional outcomes. Student learning will be assessed throughout the lesson via discussion based questions, presentations, lab report and quizzes. Students will have successfully met the outcomes when fundamental questions about the importance of work ethic, teamwork, and communication as it pertains to engineering can be observed through their own work and their peers' work.

**Modifications/Accommodations and Access for All:**

**Reflections:**

To be completed upon the end of unit.
