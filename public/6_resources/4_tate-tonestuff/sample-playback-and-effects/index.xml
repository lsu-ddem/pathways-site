      <description>To play samples use with a new Tone.Player for one sound or a new Tone.Players for multiple sounds.
Tone.Player Play one sound This is an example of playing one sound with a Tone.Player object and triggering it to start with a mouseIsPressed function.
The variable baseURL stores the beginning part of the URL which is the same for all of our sound files. We use this variable to make our code shorter and more readable.</description>
