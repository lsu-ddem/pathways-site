# Programming 
Digital Media introduces a broad array of topics related to digital media through project oriented programming of graphics, audio, and hardware applications. The motivation for this course is

{{% /teacher %}}

to provide a basic introduction to comp
uter programming using subjects that are relevant or appealing
to students who are new to technological fields of study, with little to no prior programming experience.
The course is presented in
five
segments,
introducing coding,
covering three distinct areas in digital
media, plus a
final
integration
project of these areas. There is a strong emphasis on computer
programming tasks throughout, and the hands-on exercise of digital media
tools in class is required.
After an introduction to coding concepts, t
he first
media topic
introduces real-time graphics rendering
and user interaction. The second introduces sound design
. The third introduces basic electronics and
physical computing. Finally, communication mechanisms are used
allowing the disparate elements
of
graphics, sound, and hardware to be composed into interactive
projects.
